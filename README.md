# OC Project 4 - ExpressFood: Online Food Order and Delivery Service

## Project Brief
You've been recruited by a young startup called ExpressFood. ExpressFood delivers their own high-quality meals to residences in less than 20 minutes with their team of delivery bikers.

ExpressFood delivers food to you in less than 20 minutes!
Every day, ExpressFood creates 2 main dishes and 2 desserts at its headquarters with the help of its experienced chefs. These 2 main dishes are stored in a cold setting and then given to delivery people who bike to the food to the residence that requested it...in less than 20 minutes! 

On its website, ExpressFood allows clients to order one or multiple dishes and desserts. There are no fees for delivery. Menu items change every day. 

Once a client submits their order, they see a page displaying if the order has gone out for delivery yet, as well as an estimate for their meal's arrival time.

ExpressFood needs you to make a database for them! It will need to contain: 
* A list of clients
* A list of the different daily menu items
* A list of delivery people
* An order history for each client

You will make a UML diagram to model this technical architecture. Once you're happy with the diagram, you'll create the actual MySQL database and fill it up with information (this data will obviously be made-up, but that's okay)!

## Presentation
You'll do an oral presentation of your project with a mentor in order to simulate real-life conditions. 

The presentation will be structured as follows:
Presentation of your database and UML diagram: 15-20 minutes
Q&A: 10 minutes
Towards the end of the presentation, the mentor will debrief you for approximately 5 minutes.

## Submit
* Your UML diagram
* Your MySQL database filled out with made-up (but relevant) information 

## Skills
* Use a schema when designing a database
Create technical architecture using UML diagrams
Design a database schema
